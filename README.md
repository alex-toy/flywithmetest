Hello viewer, this is my P5 project in my PHP/Symfony training at openclassroom French MOOC. This is where I learned PHP programming and the purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my skills in using the MVC design pattern.

The theme of this blog is piloting, which is my passion. The internet viewer will be able to read interesting articles to help prepare the navigations, which will be of great help. Once registered, they will even be able to write comments. I am the administrator of the blog, so I am responsible for writing articles, validating comments or even deleting improper comments, be the case.
